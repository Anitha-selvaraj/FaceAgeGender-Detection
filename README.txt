# Face, Age, and Gender Detection

This project performs real-time face detection and predicts the gender and age of detected faces using pre-trained models. The system uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade for face detection and DNN-based models for age and gender prediction.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using a webcam.
- Predicts the gender and age of detected faces.
- Modular and reusable `FaceDetector` class for face detection.
